# PYTHON-FUNDAMENTALS-CODECH


## Introduction

This repository contains various utility functions in Python such as sorting, adding and vowel count. Follow the instructions below to set up and use the functions on your local machine.


## Installation

Clone the Repository:

1. Open your terminal and in the directory where you want to install this file, run the following command to clone the repository:
'git@github.com:Ndoria-hubs/python-fundamentals-codech.git'

- Alternatively, use the source link from our repository: 'https://github.com/Ndoria-hubs/python-fundamentals-codech'

2. Navigate to the Directory:

3. Change to the repository directory: '/cd python-fundamentals-codech'

4. Setup Your Environment:

*** Ensure you have Python installed. You can check this by running: 'python--version'
Alternatively, if Python is not installed, download and install it from the official Python website. ***


## How to Run

- Open a Python Interpreter:

You can run Python code in an interpreter or script. To start the interpreter, run: 'python'
Import and Use the Functions:
* ensure you have created yu have creatde your pwn python file ( filename.py )

- You can import the functions from the lib.py file and use them. For example:

### CODE:
from lib import add_numbers, calculate_factorial

print(add_numbers(5, 3))       # Output: 8
print(calcualte_factorial(5))  # Output: 120

### END OF CODE

To run these functions, execute: 'python filename.py' in your terminal in the parent directory


## Functionality

# add_numbers function
result_add = add_numbers(10, 5)
print(f"Addition Result: {result_add}")

# is_even function
result_check = is_even(4)
print(f"Even Check Result: {result_check}")

# calcualte_factorial function
result_factorial = calcualte_factorial(6)
print(f"Factorial Result: {result_factorial}")

# reverse_string function
string_to_reverse = reverse_string(4)
print(f"Reversed Result: {string_to_reveerse}")

# Alternatively:
- Use the example sets under each function to implement and execute teh function as desired!



## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with merging or running the code:

- Ensure you are using the latest version of Git.
- Confirm that Python is correctly installed and added to your system’s PATH.
- If merge conflicts arise, resolve them manually as per Git’s instructions.
